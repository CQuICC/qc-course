## Assignment 5

**Q1**: Within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we consider (Select all that apply)

**Options**:

1. The kinetic energy of the electrons is zero, and the potential energy (Coulombic interaction) between the nuclei is a constant.

2. The kinetic energy of the nuclei is zero, and the potential energy (Coulombic interaction) between the nuclei is a constant.

3. The kinetic energy of the electrons is zero, and the potential energy (Coulombic interaction) between the electrons is a constant.

4. None of the above.

**Solution**:

The Born-Oppenheimer approximation assumes that the motion of electrons and nuclei can be separated due to their large difference in mass. The key assumptions are:
- Electrons adjust instantaneously to the positions of the nuclei.
- The kinetic energy of the nuclei is considered negligible compared to that of electrons.
- The potential energy between nuclei is treated as a constant in the electronic Hamiltonian.

Thus, the correct statement is:
- The kinetic energy of the nuclei is zero, and the potential energy between the nuclei is a constant.

**Final Answer**: 

Option 2

**Q2**: Electrons are _______ and their creation/annihilation operators _______ with each other.

**Options**

1. Bosons and anti-commute  

2. Bosons and commute  

3. Fermions and anti-commute 

4. Fermions and commute  

**Solution**:  

Electrons are fermions, meaning they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. This implies that their quantum states follow anti-commutation relations rather than commutation relations. The creation and annihilation operators for fermions satisfy the anti-commutation relation:

\[
\{a_i, a_j^\dagger\} = a_i a_j^\dagger + a_j^\dagger a_i = \delta_{ij}
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:  

- Electrons are fermions
- Their creation and annihilation operators anti-commute 

**Final Answer**: 

Option 3 (Fermions and anti-commute)

**Q3**: The gates that can occur in the qubit Hamiltonian are? (Select all that apply)  

**Options**:  

1. Hadamard gate: H  

2. All Pauli gates: X, Y, Z 

3. Identity gate: I  

4. CNOT gate  

**Solution**:  

The Hamiltonian of a qubit system is typically expressed in terms of Pauli matrices \( X, Y, Z \) and the Identity matrix \( I \), as they form a complete basis for single-qubit operators. These terms naturally appear in the Hamiltonian as they describe fundamental quantum dynamics (e.g., spin interactions, external fields).   

**Final Answer**: 

Option 2 (All Pauli gates: X, Y, Z) and Option 3 (Identity gate: I)

**Q4**: For a four-qubit state, using Jordan-Wigner mapping, the fermionic operator \( a_3^\dagger a_1 - a_1^\dagger a_3 \) equals which qubit operator?  

**Options**:  

1. \( \frac{i}{2} (X_3 Z_2 Y_1 - Y_3 Z_2 X_1) \)

2. \( \frac{i}{2} (X_2 Z_1 Y_0 - Y_2 Z_1 X_0) \)

3. \( \frac{i}{8} (X_3 Y_2 X_1 - Y_3 X_2 X_1) \)

4. \( -\frac{i}{2} (Y_3 Y_2 Y_1 - Y_3 Y_2 X_1) \)  

**Solution**:  

The Jordan-Wigner transformation expresses fermionic creation and annihilation operators in terms of Pauli matrices. The transformation for a single fermionic mode is:

\[
a_j = \frac{1}{2} (X_j + iY_j) \prod_{k=0}^{j-1} Z_k, \quad a_j^\dagger = \frac{1}{2} (X_j - iY_j) \prod_{k=0}^{j-1} Z_k
\]

For the given expression \( a_3^\dagger a_1 - a_1^\dagger a_3 \), substituting the Jordan-Wigner transformation and simplifying the commutators gives:

\[
i (X_3 Z_2 Y_1 - Y_3 Z_2 X_1)
\]

Dividing by 2 (due to the Jordan-Wigner pre-factors), we get:

\[
\frac{i}{2} (X_3 Z_2 Y_1 - Y_3 Z_2 X_1)
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **Option 1**.

**Final Answer**: 

Option 1 \( \frac{i}{2} (X_3 Z_2 Y_1 - Y_3 Z_2 X_1) \)

**Q5**: Which of the following is false about the Hartree-Fock method?  

**Options**:  

1. Coulomb interaction between the electrons is approximated such that each electron experiences an average field (potential) from the other electrons.  

2. It uses a self-consistent procedure to obtain the ground state wavefunction. 

3. The Hartree-Fock wavefunction is only an approximation to the true ground state wavefunction.  

4. Systems with only “strong electron-electron correlations” can be described using the Hartree-Fock method.  

**Solution**:  

The Hartree-Fock (HF) method is an approximation used in quantum chemistry and many-body physics. It assumes that each electron moves in an average potential due to other electrons, ignoring explicit electron-electron correlations beyond exchange interactions.  

- **Option 1** (True): HF approximates Coulomb interactions using a mean-field approach, meaning each electron experiences an average potential.

- **Option 2** (True): HF uses a self-consistent field (SCF) method to iteratively refine the wavefunction until convergence. 

- **Option 3** (True): The HF wavefunction is an approximation to the true ground-state wavefunction, as it neglects electron correlation effects.   

- **Option 4** (False): HF fails for systems with strong electron-electron correlations (e.g., strongly correlated materials), as it does not account for dynamic correlation effects.  

Thus, the incorrect (false) statement is Option 4.  

**Final Answer**: 

Option 4 (Systems with only “strong electron-electron correlations” can be described using the Hartree-Fock method.)

**Q6**: Which of the following statements are true regarding the Jordan-Wigner Mapping?  

**Options**:  

1. A mapping scheme that transforms fermionic operators into qubit operators. 

2. A mapping scheme that transforms qubit operators into fermionic operators. 

3. The number of qubits in this scheme is equal to the number of spin-orbitals in the system.

4. The number of qubits in this scheme is not equal to the number of spin-orbitals in the system.  

**Solution**:  

The Jordan-Wigner transformation is a method used in quantum computing and condensed matter physics to map fermionic operators to qubit (Pauli) operators.  

- **Option 1 (True)**: The Jordan-Wigner transformation maps fermionic operators (creation and annihilation) into qubit operators (Pauli matrices).  

- **Option 2 (False)**: It does not transform qubit operators into fermionic operators, but rather the reverse.  

- **Option 3 (True)**: In Jordan-Wigner encoding, the number of qubits required is equal to the number of spin-orbitals in the system.  

- **Option 4 (False)**: This contradicts Option 3, so it must be false.  

Thus, the correct answers are Option 1 and Option 3.  

**Final Answer**: 

Option 1 and Option 3

**Q7**: Which double excitation operator can be used to go from the state \(|0011\rangle\) to the state \(|1001\rangle\)?  

**Options**:  

1. \( a_3^\dagger a_1^\dagger a_1 a_0 \)  

2. \( a_2^\dagger a_0^\dagger a_1 a_0 \)  

3. \( a_3^\dagger a_0^\dagger a_1 a_0 \)  

4. \( a_0^\dagger a_1^\dagger a_0 a_1 \)  

**Solution**:  

- The given initial state is \(|0011\rangle\), meaning qubits 0 and 1 are occupied.  

- The target state is \(|1001\rangle\), meaning qubits 0 and 1 are unoccupied, while qubits 3 and 0 are occupied.  

To achieve this transformation, we can do the following:  
1. Remove particles from qubits 0 and 1 (annihilation operators \( a_1 \) and \( a_0 \)).  
2. Add particles to qubits 3 and 0 (creation operators \( a_3^\dagger \) and \( a_0^\dagger \)).  

The correct operator should be \( a_3^\dagger a_0^\dagger a_1 a_0 \), which matches **Option 3**.  

**Final Answer**:

Option 3 (\( a_3^\dagger a_0^\dagger a_1 a_0 \))

**Q8**: Which of the following statements are correct regarding a UCC Ansatz?  

**Options**:  

1. It is a chemically inspired ansatz and is based on the unitary version of the classical coupled cluster method.  

2. It is a chemically inspired ansatz, but it is unrelated to the classical coupled cluster method.  

3. It is a heuristic ansatz with randomly parametrized gates.  

4. It is a heuristic ansatz, and is based on the unitary version of the classical coupled cluster method.  

**Solution**: 

- The Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) ansatz is chemically inspired and derived from the classical coupled cluster (CC) method.  

- Unlike heuristic ansätze, UCC is **not** randomly parametrized but instead follows a structured form based on electron excitations.

- The correct description is that UCC is the unitary version of CC, meaning the first option is correct.  

**Final Answer**: 

**Option 1** (It is a chemically inspired ansatz and is based on the unitary version of the classical coupled cluster method.)

4. In the Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm, we approximate the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian using a parameterized Quantum circuit. The expectation value with respect to the ground state is calculated on a quantum computer, and to minimize the measured energy, the parameters are optimized by a classical optimization routine.

**Solution:**

- **VQE** is a **hybrid quantum-classical algorithm** used to approximate the ground state energy of a given **Hamiltonian**.
- It uses a **parameterized quantum circuit** (ansatz) to prepare quantum states, and the **expectation value of the Hamiltonian is measured on a quantum computer**.
- A **classical optimization routine** is used to adjust the parameters of the quantum circuit to minimize the measured energy.

**Evaluating the options:**

1. **(Incorrect)** "Quantum circuit using a parameterized Hamiltonian..." → The ground state energy is for a **Hamiltonian**, not a quantum circuit.

2. **(Incorrect)** "Expectation value calculated on a classical computer..." → The expectation value is **measured on a quantum computer**.

3. **(Incorrect)** "Quantum circuit using a parameterized Hamiltonian..." → Same mistake as (1).

4. **(Correct)** "Hamiltonian using a parameterized quantum circuit... expectation calculated on a quantum computer... parameters optimized by a classical routine." This correctly describes VQE.

**Final Answer**:  

 **Option 4**
