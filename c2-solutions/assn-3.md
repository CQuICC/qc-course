## Assignment 3

**Q1**: Let $I = \langle f_1, f_2, f_3 \rangle$, where 

\[
f_1 = x^3 + x^2 - 4x - 4, \quad f_2 = x^3 - x^2 - 4x + 4, \quad f_3 = x^3 - 2x^2 - x + 2
\]

be an ideal in $\mathbb{C}[x]$. Then, $I = ?$

1. $\langle x + 7 \rangle$

2. $\langle x - 1 \rangle$

3. $\langle x - 2 \rangle$

4. $\langle x + 5 \rangle$


**Solution:**

To find the generator of the ideal, we compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the given polynomials.

First, compute $\gcd(f_1, f_2)$:

\[
f_1 - f_2 = (x^3 + x^2 - 4x - 4) - (x^3 - x^2 - 4x + 4) = 2x^2 - 8
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
2(x^2 - 4) = 2(x - 2)(x + 2)
\]

Now, compute $\gcd(f_3, x^2 - 4)$ by substituting $f_3$:

\[
f_3 = x^3 - 2x^2 - x + 2
\]

Dividing $f_3$ by $x - 2$ gives remainder 0, which means $x - 2$ is a factor.

Thus, the ideal is generated by $\langle x - 2 \rangle$.

**Final Answer:**

$\langle x - 2 \rangle$

**Q2**: State true or false: 

\[
(x^2 - 4) \in \langle x^3 + x^2 - 4x - 4, x^3 - x^2 - 4x + 4, x^3 - 2x^2 - x + 2 \rangle.
\]

1. True

2. False  

**Solution:**

To check whether $x^2 - 4$ is in the given ideal, we need to determine if it can be expressed as a linear combination of the generators:

\[
x^2 - 4 = a(x^3 + x^2 - 4x - 4) + b(x^3 - x^2 - 4x + 4) + c(x^3 - 2x^2 - x + 2)
\]

for some polynomials $a(x), b(x), c(x) \in \mathbb{C}[x]$.

Instead of solving for $a, b, c$, we check the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the generators.

From the previous problem, we know that $x^2 - 4$ is indeed the gcd for these set of generators

Thus, the statement is true.

**Final Answer:**

True

**Q3**: Calculate $\mathbb{V}(2x^2 + 3y^2 - 11, x^2 - y^2 - 3)$, where $\mathbb{V}(\cdot)$ denotes the variety.

1. $(2,1)$  

2. $(-2,-1)$  

3. $(-2,1)$  

4. $(2,-1)$  

5. $(\pm 2, \pm 1)$  

**Solution:**

We solve the system of equations:

\[
2x^2 + 3y^2 - 11 = 0
\]

\[
x^2 - y^2 - 3 = 0
\]

Step 1: Express $x^2$ in terms of $y^2$, Rearrange the second equation:

\[
x^2 = y^2 + 3
\]

Step 2: Substituting $x^2 = y^2 + 3$ into $2x^2 + 3y^2 - 11 = 0$:

\[
2(y^2 + 3) + 3y^2 - 11 = 0
\]

\[
2y^2 + 6 + 3y^2 - 11 = 0
\]

\[
5y^2 - 5 = 0
\]

\[
5(y^2 - 1) = 0
\]

\[
y^2 = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = \pm 1
\]

Step 3: Solve for $x$, using $x^2 = y^2 + 3$, we substitute $y = \pm 1$:

\[
x^2 = 1 + 3 = 4
\]

\[
x = \pm 2
\]

The solutions are:

\[
(2,1), (2,-1), (-2,1), (-2,-1)
\]


**Final Answer:**

\[
(\pm 2, \pm 1)
\]

**Q4**: The polynomial $f(x, y, z) = 7x^2y^4z - 2xy^6 + x^2y^2$ is written with its monomials ordered according to exactly one of the following orders. Determine which monomial order was used.

1. lexicographic ordering 

2. graded lexicographic ordering  

3. graded reverse lexicographic ordering  


**Solution:**

To determine the monomial order used, we analyze how the monomials are sorted:

$7x^2y^4z, \quad -2xy^6, \quad x^2y^2$

Step 1: Compute the total degrees

- $7x^2y^4z$ has total degree $2 + 4 + 1 = 7$.

- $-2xy^6$ has total degree $1 + 6 = 7$.

- $x^2y^2$ has total degree $2 + 2 = 4$.

Since the terms are sorted by total degree first, this suggests a graded order.

Step 2: Resolve ties using lexicographic or reverse lexicographic order

Among the first two terms:

- $7x^2y^4z$ vs. $-2xy^6$, both have total degree $7$.

- In graded lexicographic order, we compare exponent vectors lexicographically:

  - $(2,4,1)$ vs. $(1,6,0)$  
  
  - Since $2 > 1$, we keep $x^2y^4z$ first, which matches the given order.

- In graded reverse lexicographic order, we compare exponent vectors by the last nonzero difference:  

  - $(2,4,1) - (1,6,0) = (1,-2,1)$, and since $-2$ is the last nonzero entry (negative), the order should be reversed.  
  
  - This does not match the given order.

Thus, the correct monomial order is graded lexicographic ordering.

**Final Answer:**

graded lexicographic ordering

**Q5**: Suppose $I = \langle xy^2 - x, x - y^3 \rangle \subseteq \mathbb{C}[x,y]$. Let $f = x^7y^2 + x^3y^2 - y + 1$. The remainder obtained on dividing $f$ by the Gröbner basis of $I$, using graded lexicographic ordering $x >_{grlex} y$, is

1. $2x - y + 1$  

2. $xy^2 - x$  

3. $y^3 - x$  

4. $x^2 - xy$  

**Solution:**

To find the remainder of $f$ upon division by the Gröbner basis of $I$, we can simply use **SageMath**.

We compute the remainder of \( f = x^7 y^2 + x^3 y^2 - y + 1 \) when divided by the Gröbner basis of the ideal 
\( I = \langle xy^2 - x, x - y^3 \rangle \), using graded lexicographic ordering.

```python
# Define the polynomial ring with graded lexicographic ordering (grlex)
R = PolynomialRing(CC, ['x', 'y'], order='degrevlex')  # 'degrevlex' corresponds to graded lex
x, y = R.gens()  # Extract generators

# Define the ideal I
I = ideal(x*y^2 - x, x - y^3)

# Compute the Gröbner basis of I
G = I.groebner_basis()

# Define the polynomial f
f = x^7 * y^2 + x^3 * y^2 - y + 1

# Compute the remainder of f when divided by the Gröbner basis of I
remainder = f.reduce(G)

# Print the remainder
remainder
```


**Final Answer**:

The final remainder is:

\[
2x - y + 1
\]

**Q6**: Suppose $I = \langle xz - y, xy + 2z^2, y - z \rangle \subseteq \mathbb{C}[x, y, z]$. Let $f = x^3z - 2y^3$. The claim is $f \in I$, state whether the claim is true or false.

1. True

2. False

**Solution**

To determine whether \( f = x^3z - 2y^3 \) is in the ideal \( I = \langle xz - y, xy + 2z^2, y - z \rangle \subseteq \mathbb{C}[x, y, z] \), we need to check if \( f \) can be expressed as a combination of the generators of \( I \). In other words, there should be no remainder when we reduce \( f \) with \( I \).

```python
# Define the polynomial ring with lexicographic ordering
R = PolynomialRing(CC, ['x', 'y', 'z'], order='lex')
x, y, z = R.gens()  # Extract generators

# Define the ideal I
I = ideal(x*z - y, x*y + 2*z^2, y - z)

# Compute the Gröbner basis of I
G = I.groebner_basis()

# Define the polynomial f
f = x^3 * z - 2 * y^3

# Compute the remainder of f when divided by the Gröbner basis of I
remainder = f.reduce(I)

# Print the remainder
remainder
```
This gives us a non-zero remainder, therefore, the claim that \( f \in I \) is \textbf{false}.

**Final answer**

False

**Q8**: The integer feasibility problem for the system of equations given by (1) in **Q7** is solvable.

**Options**:

1. True

2. False


**Solution**:

We consider the system:

\[
3x_1 + 2x_2 + x_3 = 10
\]

\[
4x_1 + 3x_2 + x_3 = 12
\]

Step 1: Subtracting the first equation from the second,

\[
(4x_1 + 3x_2 + x_3) - (3x_1 + 2x_2 + x_3) = 12 - 10
\]

\[
x_1 + x_2 = 2
\]

Step 2: Rewriting the system,

\[
x_2 = 2 - x_1
\]

\[
3x_1 + 2(2 - x_1) + x_3 = 10
\]

\[
3x_1 + 4 - 2x_1 + x_3 = 10
\]

\[
x_1 + x_3 = 6
\]

\[
x_3 = 6 - x_1
\]

It is clear that for any integer \( x_1 \), \( x_2 \) and \( x_3 \) remain integers.  
For example, choosing \( x_1 = 0 \):

\[
x_2 = 2, \quad x_3 = 6
\]

Thus, the system has integer solutions.

**Answer**:

True
